 abstract    = "FAIMS Mobile is a native Android application supported by an
                Ubuntu server facilitating human-mediated field research
                across disciplines. It consists of `core' Java and Ruby
                software providing a platform for data capture, which can be
                deeply customised using `definition packets' consisting of XML
                documents (data schema and UI) and Beanshell scripts
                (automation). Definition packets can also be generated using
                an XML-based domain-specific language, making customisation
                easier. FAIMS Mobile includes features allowing rich and
                efficient data capture tailored to the needs of fieldwork. It
                also promotes synthetic research and improves transparency and
                reproducibility through the production of comprehensive
                datasets that can be mapped to vocabularies or ontologies as
                they are created.",
